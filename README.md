🏐 Amateur Volleyball Analytics – Archived Tools

Welcome!
This repository contains archived versions of my volleyball analytics tools.
These spreadsheets were used in my first projects and show the way I approached match analysis step by step.

⚠️ Note: My latest tools (currently in use for projects) are not included here.
This repo is meant as a showcase of my development journey and learning process.

📂 Contents
1. Player Performance Dashboard (W/N/L version)

Early version of my player evaluation tool.

Used a Won / Neutral / Lost tagging model for player actions.

Produced metrics like Success, Impact and Contribution.

Visualization included radar charts and bar charts.

More spreadsheets will be added over time as new tools are developed.

🚀 Why archive these?

To show how my tools evolved over time.

To give others an idea of how one can start simple and gradually add sophistication.

To document my personal learning path as I move toward becoming a sports analyst.

🔒 Current Status

I’m now working with more advanced tools (e.g. 0–3 index dashboards, improved momentum tracking with time-outs & rotation efficiency).

These are not shared publicly yet, but they are actively used in my projects.
